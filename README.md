# flask-digitrecognizer
A digit recognizer web app in Flask, using the sklearn MNIST dataset. 

This is a simple web application that allows the user to draw a digit on a canvas, which will then be predicted by a machine learning model.
The model uses random forest classification to predict the user's drawn digits.


Below is an example:

Currently, it seems to have trouble with the digits 6, 7 and 9.
